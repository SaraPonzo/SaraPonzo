# Hi there 👋, I'm Sara

🎓 I'm an Italian MSc student in **Financial Risk and Data Analysis**, passionate about statistical modeling, data science, and R programming

🌱 Currently learning and working on:

- Statistical modeling for risk and volatility forecasting through GARCH and SVM;
- Extreme Value Theory and the advantages of Panel Data in GEV estimation;
- Hidden Markov Models and the EM algorithm for likelihood estimation.

Here you'll find a collection of my academic and personal projects, mostly focused on time series analysis, risk modeling, and statistical inference.

I am always eager to learn, experiment, and collaborate!
